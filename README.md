# get_next_line
### My get_next_line project at Cursus 42 in December 2020

##### The GNL_BONUS doesn't work [TIMED OUT] but the code has one static variable -> TOTAL : 107
Enjoy !

| Function      | status|
| ------------- |-------|
| GNL           | OK    |
| ONE STATIC    | OK    |
| GNL_BONUS     | KO    |
